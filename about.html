		<h3>About Posters</h3>
		<p class="text">Walking around downtown Toronto you will notice a distinct form of advertising. A form of advertising you may only see in some of the largest, most distinct cities in the world. Also common in cities like New York and London is the street poster or sets of street posters. Always bold and unique to capture your attention but always new and cycling. This focus on distinct graphic design and subject matter made the street poster a perfect scope of items to explore within this site.</p>
